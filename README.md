## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a **loan approval prediction system** for microfinance applications in Sri Lanka. It leverages multiple machine learning and deep learning models to predict loan default risk and recommend approval decisions.

Key features include:

- Generation of a **synthetic dataset** mimicking real-world microfinance loan applications.
- Training of four predictive models:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. Random Forest
  3. XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
  4. Deep Neural Network
- Ensemble prediction using all models for robust decision-making.
- Feature importance and model evaluation visualizations.
- Ready-to-use models for deployment.
